				Hello!  
				<br><br><br>
				I am <b>Alice Bibaud</b>, a junior Computer Science (CS) student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), concentrating in Theory, Algorithms, and Mathematics.  I am interested in data visualization, open source technologies, signal processing, geometry, and making computing more accessible and practical for all to use.
				<br><br><br>				My academic and professional passions run broad and deep, and often add meaning to one another; my goal with this website is to show you some of them.
