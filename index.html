				Today, I hopped on several planes - the first to Washington DC, the next to London Heathrow Airport.  The travel was pleasant; I wrote in my journal and did a bit of reading whilst waiting before departing, and slept through the trans-Atlantic flight.  which was quite pleasant, and landed in London Heathrow Airport without a hitch.  
				<br><br>
				Caught the Paddington line and met Emma at the beautiful train station there; we walked to her flat together through the misty afternoon.  Once there, we had lunch with an assortment of her friends from King's.  We got to talking about politics, because that's what they all study - it was enlightening to hear their perspectives, particularly because each person had their own depth of knowledge in different areas.
				<br><br>
				That was pretty much the day - getting acquainted with the friends, the flat, and the timezone.  I took a fat nap, Emma made a bangin salad, and we went to sleep early.

				<br><br>
				Emma and I both woke up at 8:00am.  We got ready, had some coffee (at home, then at a cafe, then later on, at another cafe...), and we were off to King's College campus!  We traveled via the bus - you know, a red double decker one.  Normally people keep to themselves on London transport, but a Serbian lady came over to us and started babbling about this and that.  She also told me that I was an American student studying Computer Science, and that I had never been on one of these buses before...
				<br><br>
				We landed at King's, and I explored the Strand while Emma went to class.  First, I went to Pret just for the wifi; student life is like that.  Then, meandered down the road to Waterstones, the British answer to Barnes & Noble.  Peeked through all the books, then did some homework in the cafe upstairs.

				The real magic of the day was revealed in the National Gallery.  Wandering through the halls, I got to read <i>~ everything ~</i> and fully sink into each work the way I've always wanted to in an art museum.

				Lastly: Van Gogh.  Beautiful, beautiful works of his are featured in the gallery, many of which he completed while he was institutionalized.  I've garnered a deeper appreciation for his work, especially regarding the textures of the plants he created.  They're practically relief scupltures, in how thick he laid the paint down.
				<br><br>
				Got to another cafe (on a bridge???), did some work there, and eventually met up with Emma.  We worked together there for quite some time, until we (exhaustedly) trundled back to her flat, again via the bus.  This was a freezing day - think that took a lot of energy out of us.  We made some ramen, watched a bit of a documentary, and had another early night.

				Got a slightly later start today - Emma didn't have class until later, so we got to King's at 12.  I popped a squat at Pret and did some work, then met her and Hugo at a lovely little cafe in their quad (all beautiful marble 19th century style buildings).  We had lunch together, chatted for awhile, then went off on a walk to enjoy the unreasonably beautiful sunny weather and explore the historic campus.  We spent an hour or two just looking for sunny green spots to sit in; very pleasant.
				<br><br>
				Then, Hugo went to class, so Emma and I went to find some of her groupmates.  They've been working on an incredibly interesting policy project for awhile, which they are to present at a contest hosted by the BBC and judged by the former Australian prime minister!

				From there, Emma and I went to Chinatown to go dinner - we ended up getting some delicious dim sum style buns, which we ravenously ate as we meandered through the neightborhood.  We also got some candy; we were headed to see the new Batman movie with her two roommates.  Luckily, we made it to the theatre on time, and all had a blast watching the film.  DC did a wonderful - or should I say <i>marvelous</i> - job with this movie.  Please watch it if you can!

				Wedesday, March 8th, 2022
				<br><br>
				Batman was a three hour long extravaganza, so I didn't get to sleep for awhile - which means I woke up pretty late as well.  That's what I get for going out, I suppose.  That morning, I got myself together, made up the room I'm staying in, and got ready to go out and explore London!
				<br><br>
				First, I went to see the Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221B Baker Street.  It took me awhile to walk there from Emma's flat, because I took the route that walks along the canal and Regent's Park.  Once I arrived though, I was astouned.  The concept of a museum for a fictional story is odd, and I was stuck by that doubly when I got there.. but it makes sense here.  It documents not only the story line of the Sherlock Holmes series, but also the Victorian era itself, the cultural impact the franchise had, and sets up some of the rooms that Holmes and Dr. Watson often spent time in.  It was a very lovely time.  Again, there was a lot to read here too, which I enjoyed immensely.
				<br><br>
				Next, I walked through Picadilly Circus in pursuit of lunch.  It was some incredible people watching - felt very Times Square, but better.  There were a lot of shops with art in the windows, and people speaking different languages; even though I was just passing through, that was an experience I'll remember in its own right.

			<div class="panel photo" style="background-image: url(images/london/carnaby.jpeg); height: 80vh;"></div>
			<journal style="background-image: url(images/journal/journal6.jpg);">
				Then - lunch!  I found a cute little spot in Soho that sold bangers and mash and sticky toffee pudding, so I just had to go.  The food was delicious, and it was very pleasant to eat a meal at a dining establishment on my own.  Think that's a first for me.
				<br><br>
				I left very full, in pursuit of Portnum and Mason, a very fancy gift store.  They originally got famous for their teas, but now they're like.  If Tiffany's made tea and everything that goes with tea - beautiful biscuit tins, chocolates, wine, china, tea accessories.  It's an emporium of British Posh-ness decked out in baby blue and gold.  It was hard to not buy everything there because it all looked so good, but I managed.  From there, hopped on the bus back to the flat and took a nap.
				<br><br>
				I awoke and left the flat yet again to meet Emma at her local tube station; she, I, and a few of her friends were slated to be a team in a pub quiz.  We got dead last in the competition, but we had a great time trying to figure out questions that were far above our pay grade and getting too excited when we knew the answers.  Emma and I meandered back to the flat after talking to one of the girls for awhile outside the pub.  Maybe these are friends we'll keep!

				Once Emma and I finally got up and at em, she went to class, and I went looking for a place to study.  I ended up traversing Little Venice in search of a cafe to bust out some differential equations homework at, and came upon a lovely French coffee spot in a houseboat!  There was no wifi, so all I could do was math and journal.  These are good things.
				<br><br>
				After awhile (and I mean AWHILE), I found my way back to Emma's flat and started doing some work on this here website.  It's been coming along - we're making progress for sure, though there's still a long way to go.  Emma and Hugo came back home around 6:00, and I just kept working until some of their political science friends came around.  We had a dinner party of sorts: a combination conversation, board game, and philisophical salon.  These are the nerdy friends, with whom my dear friend likes to party hard and yell about things with.  Some topics discussed into the wee hours, among others, were:
				<blockquote>
				How Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning will never exceed what humans can either quantify or learn themselves because they aren't, and won't ever be, cabable of abstract thought;
				</blockquote><blockquote>
				A comparison of the imperial and metric systems, and why England uses both for some reason, which led into:
				</blockquote><blockquote>
				How much the Gregorian Calendar sucks.  As a result of this, we made a new calendar system based entirely on the solar calendar (solstices, equinoxes, and the four midpoints between) to divide the year into eight long months that coincide exactly with the seasons (and vary to compensate for differences).  Oh, and no leap years: the days are calculated such that the extra time gets spread out through the whole year;
				</blockquote><blockquote>
				The relationship between testosterone, estrogen, and agression;
				</blockquote><blockquote>
				All of the other things you'd expect of highly educated people studying the humanities - The Repulbic, socialism, modern "leftism", some cool and funky physics videos, social clout, Luxemborge, Determinism, Geometry (of course), and generally making fun of the French.
				</blockquote>
				Needless to say, we had a lovely time together; the group of people who don't live with Emma didn't evacuate the flat until 3:30am.  This is exactly what I thought I would find here, and am so happy to have been able to listen to such cool humans talk for awhile.

				<br><br>
				On Friday, I woke up at 8am, somehow rested after our wild and wacky evening.  I cleaned up a little bit and worked on this website quite lot, until about noon.  When Emma and I rallied, it was 1 or 2pm, and we were both in dire need of caffiene.  We stopped to grab some on the way to King's college.  I stopped at Cafe Nero on Waterloo Bridge again - this was to be my first stop on my way to the Tate Modern, where I intended to spend the rest of my day.
				<br><br>
				I took my time crossing the bridge and getting there; South Bank is lovely!  Though once I got there, it was another situation of reading everything in sight and just getting SO absorbed by the art.  Some highlights:

				Some absolutely delightful sculptures by Phyllida Barlow.  Her work was somehow so emotionally evocative that I found myself laughing aloud at... literally a clothes drying rack covered in a happy yellow jackson pollock-like coat of paint.  It did manage to capture movement and a geographic type of feeling that I had never seen before.

				I was also amazed at the work from artists in the Gutai Art Association.  Gutai means the physical embodiment of an idea; for them, actions and materials were equally important in their work.  They did some crazy stuff like paint with their feet and throw stuff at canvases; also lots of cool dancing, and work made out of household objects.

				I also saw some work I had studied before; we're got The Fountain, pictured above, which is literally just a urinal with "R. Mutt 1917" painted on it.  It started a whole artistic movement within the absurdist school of thought called Dadism.

				Also "Whaam!", by Roy Lichtenstein.  I had to paint this upside-down and backwards as part of a study I did at art camp.  All of Lichtenstein's work is popular (the whole genre being called "pop"), but he truly did some cool stuff for comics in the future.

				I got a bit lost coming back from there, but that's ok; Emma was in an important meeting that ran late anyway, so I didn't feel too bad.  I even got a bit of time to work on this website in Nero once again!  I reall am enjoying this, I must say.
				<br><br>
				From there, we walked to Soho to go out and grab some dinner.  We went to a lovely Thai place called Rosa's - we got some really fun drinks and talked deep into the night, even long after we left the restaurant.  I was reminded why Emma is one of my favorite people in the world: she thinks about everything and has a good time even so.

				We woke up relatively early today, another beautiful and sunny day!  Emma was to do work with her group mates at 12:30, but we live pretty close and had time, so we meandered down to Portabello Market.  It's such a hustling, bustling place, and there are people from all over the world selling their wares there.  We stopped by a lady selling vintage silk products, and Emma got this incredible blue gown for a ball coming up!  She couldn't stay long after that, so I spent a peaceful afternoon browsing the shops.  Got some handmade gifts for friends and family that I'm pretty excited about!
				<br><br>
				Got lost on the way back again, but I needed the walk.  It was a beautiful day - maybe I got a little bit of vitamin D.  Got back to the flat, did some work, did an interview coding assesment, worked through some documents. It was a very productive afternoon.
				<br><br>
				We ended the evening by having some dinner with our friends (Emma's groupmates, whom I had gotten to know pretty well by that point) at the flat, and then going to a costume birthday party!  She went as Juliette, from Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet.  Me?.. I went as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

				It was a really cool party, populated by students from all over the world.  Most of them were French, with some wild stories - I met a dude who had worked in San Jose, and had recently created a house devoted to house parties; I met the daughter of a world famous jockey, going to school and currently working as an equine breeder.  Exactly what you would expect a party in a wealthy french house to look like - very, very cool, and very, very unfamiliar to me.  After I napped on a couch for a bit, we went home at like 1:00am.  We immediately put some mac and cheese on the stove, ate it in silence, and went to bed.  That definitely felt like high school.

				Woke up at 6:00am to get ready and go back to Troy.  Ate some breakfast, showered, stripped my bed, did some dishes, wrote some notes, and walked out of the flat.  Stopped at a convenience store to grab some last-minute postcards; guess I should post them soon.
				<br><br>
				I loved London with all of my heart, and will miss her dearly.  I would highly recommend visiting, and would even more so recommend seeing it through the eyes of a dear friend and a local.  I'm incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to visit when I did, and wish Emma and her beautiful city the best.

				FIN.
